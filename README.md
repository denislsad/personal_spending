In this project I tried to understand how did I spent money for the last couple of years.
The data is taken from my personal expenses accounting from July 30 to September 27, 2022. I kept it by manually adding values after every purchase, so I could take a look later at the way I used my money and draw some insights.

Having this data, I tried to solve the following problems:

1. Clean the data â€“ I created this table in a way that is more efficient for Excel; the only assumption is that I didn't start addition with the equal sign. 

2. Summarize my spending for two months.

3. Which items did I spend the most on?

4. How do the three categories (Meals, Other, Extra) differ?

5. Break down the Extra category and compare it to the other two.
