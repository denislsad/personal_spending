In this project I tried to understand how did I spent money for the last couple of years.
The data is taken from a statement of account for the period from August 1, 2020 to August 31, 2022 and from my personal expenses accounting from July 30 to September 27, 2022.

I decided to limit the analysis for one of the tables (statement of account) to only include the spending on coffee, so the project wouldn't be blown out.
Having only coffee spending in the project wouldn't feel sufficient for a full-fledged project (as the statement of account table contains only information about transaction dates and cost). The second table has more details but is limited only to three months. Having in one project two not connected datasets (one for a specific type of product for two years and one for a general spending table for only two months) might seem strange, but I decided to pack them into one single project, so I could take a look at the way I used my money and draw some insights.

With the help of visualization and, if needed, statistical tests I'd like to solve the following problems:

[The Detailed Accounting table]

1. Summarize my spending for two months.

2. Which items did I spend the most on?

3. How do the three categories (Meals, Other, Extra) differ?

4. Break down the Extra category and compare it to the other two.

[The Account Statement table]

5. Summarize the coffee consumption by month.

6. Did coffee consumption increase or decreased over time?

7. Did I visit the coffee shops more often in winter?

8. What was the average check for coffee and how many visits I made â€“ by month?

9. Break down the coffee consumption by days of the week and find whether I spent the most and visit more often on weekends.

10. What is the percentage of coffee in total expenses?
